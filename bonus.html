    <p>Neapolitan Mastiff is a sizeable dog, finding its place in many moments in history.
         The floppy and wrinkled pup may not seem that agile,
         but they are fairly confident, quick, and active.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                These dogs are highly protective of the owner families,
                 giving very strong and fearless stares.
            </li>
            <li>Neapolitan Mastiffs are easily found in shelters and rescues at a lower price,
                 though they can be adopted from breeders as well.</li>
            <li>These dogs do not have many needs when it comes to exercise.
                 A bit of room at home and a little time on a leash for a walk is good enough for them.</li>
        </ol>
