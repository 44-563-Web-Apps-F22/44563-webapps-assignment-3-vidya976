<p>I like to read novels and watch netflix. I like playing outdoor games like badminton, volley ball.My favorite novel is The Game surviors.The novel is about a group of people, who are victims of the power struggle in a company.They come together to fight against the company.My favourite visiting spot is ooty. I like to visit that in may month as its Botanical garden will be in full bloom and it is a site that i wouldn't miss for anything. The fresh smell of flowers and the cool breeze in that area during that time and homemade chocolates that are available in that area are the best.</p>
